# adventofcode2021

This year in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

As it's been quite a few years since I've written any Rust, I set up a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) for vscode (defaults) to compile with.

After initially running into some issues with the snap-installed version of docker and apparmor, switching to the non-snap docker.io package has things running fairly smoothly.

## Note!

I'm probably implementing these things *all wrong* so if you happen to be reading this feel free to tell me how wrong and what do to instead!.

## Note on puzzle input data

Since AOC's input data is different for everyone, you won't be able to just run this code and have it create the right responses for your own submissions.
